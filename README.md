# [Interesting!](https://axelalex2.github.io)

A simple web application, with which you can create your very own version of the "Interesting"-Meme!

## Usage

Just put in the number of notes you want to generate, select if you want to predetermine the movement of notes, and which style the app should choose for you, one style per line. If you don't want to have a style, just leave the text field empty.

## Bugs

This project was hacked together in 40 minutes, but bugs are unlikely to happen. If they do appear, please tell me. Further development (like a better layout or sound features) is probably not happening since i am invested in other things, and in addition to that, i am not a trained web developer.

## Shoutout

Shoutout to TwoSetViolin, great content you guys create for classical musicians. I have searched long enough for a channel like you guys have, even if you don't represent my primary instrument. Brett and Eddy, you guys Roque!
